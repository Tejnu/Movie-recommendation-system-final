# Movie Recommendation System  

📋 **Overview**  
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a Python-based application powered by Machine Learning to recommend movies based on user preferences. It combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The system includes a user-friendly interface built using Flask for interactive movie recommendations.  

✨ **Key Features**  
- **Interactive Movie Search**: Input a movie title to receive tailored recommendations.  
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes movie features like genres, keywords, cast, and director for recommendations.  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user behavior patterns.  
- **Data Insights**: Includes genre distribution, runtime distribution, and other visualizations for exploratory analysis.  

**Dataset**
The system uses a movie dataset (movies.csv) containing features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.

| **Programming Language** | Python                                                                     |  
| **Framework**          | Flask                                                                      |  
| **Libraries**          | pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, TF-IDF, Pickle      |  
| **ML Techniques**      | TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, Collaborative Filtering           |  

🚀 **Installation**  
Follow these steps to set up the application:  
1. Clone the Repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git  
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System  
   ```  
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`  
   ```  
3. Install Dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
4. Run the Application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  

⚙️ **How It Works**  

**Step-by-Step Guide**  
1. **Upload Data**: Load the movie dataset (pre-configured as `movies.csv`).  
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, vectorized using TF-IDF, and models are trained.  
3. **Input Search**: Provide a movie name to get recommendations.  
4. **Explore Results**: Analyze the recommendations with visualizations and download the results as needed.  

💻 **Code Highlights**  

**Text Vectorization**  
Transforms text features using TF-IDF for similarity computation.  
```python  
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer  

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)  
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(movie_data['combined_features'])  
```  

**Similarity Computation**  
Calculates cosine similarity between movies.  
```python  
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity  

cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)  
```  

🎯 **Applications**  
- **Movie Streaming Platforms**: Provide personalized recommendations to users.  
- **Entertainment Portals**: Enhance user experience with tailored suggestions.  
- **Data Enthusiasts**: Explore data-driven approaches to recommendation systems.  

📊 **Model and Features**  
- **Dataset**: Contains features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.  
- **Models Used**: TF-IDF Vectorization for content-based filtering and collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations.
